### Why RepoDb

 - Very lightweight and very fast because of IL. We are the fastest, faster than Dapper.
 - Supports massive ORM operations.
 - Less code, clean and fluent.
 - Dynamic fast-switching between light and massive operations.
 - Unique and developer friendly expression tree.

### Goal

To be the fastest and easy-to-use lightweight ORM.

### Vision

To provide more flexibility and fast-switching development approach, whether to use the massive or lightweight ORM operations.

### Principles

 - We will keep it simple as possible (KISS principle)
 - We will help developers to be more focus on SOLID principle
 - We will make it fast as possible
 - We will make it more flexible
 - We will never ever do try-catch inside the library
 - We will never make complex implementations (specially for complex Join Queries)
